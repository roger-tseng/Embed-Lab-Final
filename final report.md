### Abstract
We use STM32 and Rpi to create an interactive way for interior design. By setting up RSSI network, we 
can do the triangulation and find the user's location. The user can press the button on the STM32 board 
to trigger IRQ function for setting furniture. The STM32 board also supports accelerometer and magnetometer 
for motion and heading detection, which allows user to switch object and change facing direction. The user 
can walk around the room and place the furniture at anywhere he/she wants. This project is demonstrated on 
MineCraft engine.

### Motivation
It's not a easy task for people to design the interior decoration. Traditional interior design model are 
usually accessed by mouses and keyboards. All the furnitures must be set up on the computer remotely, which 
may be less straightforward.... Thus, we want to provide a more interactive and straightforward way, so that the user 
can directly walk inside the new house and place the furniture at their wish.
